Included are the following:

1. cpu.cpp 
2. Summary.docx
3. sample5.txt

to compile cpu.cpp:
use$ g++ cpu.cpp

if an error in compiling occurs,
use$ g++ -std=c++0x cpu.cpp
you are welcome to rename a.out if you desire.

execute as
$ ./a.out <filename>> <timer>


sample5.txt is one of the test cases I used to verify my interupt handle functioned properly, by pushing things on the stack while incrementing a number to build it up.
